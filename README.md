Hints:

For instructions 3 through 6, we have to ask ourselves the question: “How do we know if the mouse is in a given corner?” To accomplish this, we need to develop a more specific if statement. For example, we would say: “If the mouse X location is greater than 100 pixels and the mouse Y location is greater than 100 pixels, draw a black rectangle in the bottom right corner.
